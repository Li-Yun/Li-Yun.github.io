Hello, my name is Li-Yun Wang (王棣雲). I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Portland State University. I love to solve computer vision problems such as object recognition and detection problems and image and video processing prolbmes by leveraging image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques since I was pursuing my M.S. degree. During my Ph.D. journey, my research comprises computer vision and multimedia computing by utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. Addtionally, I also like to solve research problems in Computer Vision System. Specifically, I am passionate about the following research topics: <br/>

(1) **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Especially for removing adversarial perturbation and enhancing the robustness of the deep convolutional neural network by leveraging image processing techniques. In the future, I am happy to adopt machine learning or deep learning to resolve research problems in adversarial machine learning, <br/>
(2) **Traditional Computer Vision Problems**: these problems can be object recognization and detection, etc, <br/>
(3) **Neural Netwrok Model Compression and Optimiazation**, <br/>
(4) **Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Computer vision**: Currently, I am working an image deblurring prooject with a research, and
(5) **Design User-Friendly Multimedia Tools for Computer Vision Applications (e.g., Object Detection and Recognization)** <br/>
