Hello, my name is Li-Yun Wang (王棣雲) or James Wang. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Portland State University (PSU). Before joining the PhD program at PSU, I was supverised by Dr. Liang-Hua Chen and received my master degree from Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, in 2012. I love to work on computer vision problems such as object recognition, object detection, and image and video processing prolbmes by leveraging image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques since I was pursuing my M.S. degree. During my Ph.D. journey, my research interest comprises Computer Vision (CV) and Multimedia Computing (MC). Specifically, I would like to utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve research problems in CV and MC. Addtionally, I like to solve research problems in Computer Vision System. Specifically, I am passionate about the following research topics: <br/>

(1) **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Especially for removing adversarial perturbation and enhancing the robustness of the deep convolutional neural network by leveraging image processing techniques. In the future, I am happy to adopt machine learning or deep learning to resolve research problems in adversarial machine learning, <br/>
(2) **Traditional Computer Vision Problems**: these problems can be object recognization and detection, etc, <br/>
(3) **Neural Netwrok Model Compression and Optimiazation**: research and develop new model compression techniques for cross domain applications (in progress), <br/>
(4) **Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Computer vision**: Currently, I am working an image deblurring prooject with a research, and <br/>
(5) **Design User-Friendly Multimedia Tools for Computer Vision Applications (e.g., Object Detection and Recognization)** <br/>
